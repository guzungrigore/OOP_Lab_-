# OOP_Lab_0

1. On my Windows OS, I firstly installed Ubuntu and an app called Rufus. With the help of this app I was able to create a bootable USB with Ubuntu on it.
Then I restarted my laptop with the USB in it and I followed the Ubuntu installation process. After the installation was done I was logged in on Linux.
2. In the terminal I used the command "sudo apt install zsh" to install, obviosly, zsh. Following by the command "chsh -s /bin/zsh" to change my primary
Shell to zsh. With the command "sudo apt-get install git curl" and a link found on the internet I installed oh-my-zsh. Next I wrote in terminal "sudo
apt-get install git" to get git on my Ubuntu. For gcc compiler had to use 2 commands "sudo apt install build-essential" and "sudo apt-get install manpages-
dev". Also in the end I installed my favorite editor, which is Intellij IDEA.
3. Here we started with making a new directory with the command "mkdir" and I named it newdir. With the command "ls -l" we can see all the directories,
and typing the name of our newly made directory put me in there. With command "git init" we initiated a git repository in that file. using the command 
"nano" we opened the compiler in the terminal and I named it "hello.c". There I wrote my hello world program, I saved it and exited the compiler. Then with 
the command "gcc hello.c -o hello" I said a working file of it and with "./hello" we displayed the program in our terminal. Then using "nano Makefile"
we oppened a new compiler and wrote some text that you can see in the images, then using "make' we saved the file and with "./a.out" we made a functional 
hello world program in our directory. In the end I added all the screenshot that I did in that directory.
After that I used "git add ." to add all files to staging. With the "git commit" I put all the files on the branch and with the "git push" I pushed all the
files on he GitHub. But as the 1st time I set up the repository in the github and pasted the link in the terminal and with a key generated on my account 
I was able to link the Github repository with the one localy. And finally git pushed my files in GitHub.
